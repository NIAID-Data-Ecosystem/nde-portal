# About the Discovery Portal

### What is the Discovery Portal?

The Discovery Portal is a tool within the NIAID Data Ecosystem that focuses on
the findability of data. It allows users to search simultaneously across
millions of publicly available datasets to find immune-mediated and infectious
disease data for reanalysis. It also provides a resource for finding
bioinformatics and computational tools that can aid analyses.

### How can it help my research?

The Discovery Portal is a tool within the NIAID Data Ecosystem that focuses on
the findability of data. It allows users to search simultaneously across
millions of publicly available datasets to find immune-mediated and infectious
disease data for reanalysis. It also provides a resource for finding
bioinformatics and computational tools that can aid analyses.

- Search across repositories to quickly find datasets relevant to your research.
- Find tools related to your analysis methods that can enhance or streamline
  your research.
- Use advanced searching and filtering to efficiently narrow down millions of
  results to your specific parameters.
- Explore data and tools you didn’t know were available. Discover new datasets
  that can bring other dimensions into your analyses.
- Download metadata or use the metadata visualization tools to gather new
  insights about what’s available.
- Track research across funding programs or specific scientific areas.

### **What are its limitations?**

- **We include a limited number of data sources.** The Discovery Portal does not
  aggregate every dataset from every source related to infectious and allergic
  disease. The Discovery Portal pulls from a
  [list of data sources](https://data-staging.niaid.nih.gov/portal/sources/). If
  there are data sources you’d like us to include, you may
  [suggest a source](https://github.com/NIAID-Data-Ecosystem/nde-crawlers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=suggest-a-new-resource.md&title=%5BSOURCE%5D).

- **Results may include irrelevant datasets.** As the Discovery Portal
  aggregates data from some generalist repositories, search results may include
  datasets that are not related to immune-mediated, allergic, or infectious
  disease.

- **You cannot directly download data or analyze it within the Discovery
  Portal.** The Discovery Portal is not a repository. The Discovery Portal can
  be used to search across repositories to find if/where data exists. It helps
  support the FAIRness of data. However, users cannot analyze data in the
  Discovery Portal, nor download data directly from the Discovery Portal.

- **Metadata fields may be incomplete.** The Discovery Portal attempts to
  standardize metadata that is available; however, we cannot create information
  that does not exist. If metadata is missing at the source, it will also be
  absent within the Discovery Portal.

### **What sources do we use?**

The Discovery Portal aggregates data and computational tools across numerous
sources, including NIAID-supported repositories, general biomedical
repositories, and other generalist sources. See our
[list of data sources](https://data-staging.niaid.nih.gov/portal/sources/)

  About the NIAID Data Ecosystem
</h2>

</Box>

The [NIAID Data Ecosystem](https://data-staging.niaid.nih.gov/) provides a
secure environment to find, access, and analyze immune-mediated and infectious
disease data to speed the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
The NIAID Data Ecosystem is grouped into two complementary tools: the Discovery
Portal and the Analysis Workspace. The Discovery Portal is used to find and
access datasets and tools. The Analysis Workspace is used to efficiently analyze
data with reproducible tools in private or collaborative projects.

### **Who are we?**

[Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/) has teamed up with
[Scripps Research](https://www.scripps.edu/) to build the NIAID Data Ecosystem.

Seven Bridges was founded in 2009 with the mission of accelerating effective
biomedical research in the cloud at the 1M+ person scale.

Today Seven Bridges offers a commercial platform (Seven Bridges Core
Infrastructure, SB-CI) to deliver customized ecosystems in support of large
scale projects like the NIAID DE since 2014.

Scripps Research is one of the largest non-profit biomedical research institutes
in the United States, and is consistently ranked as one of the most innovative
biomedical research institutes in the world (Nature Index).

On this backdrop of high-impact science, Scripps Research also maintains a
strong focus on developing infrastructure to organize, visualize, and analyze
biomedical data.
