## Metadata-driven data discovery

The NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal enables users to find datasets from a
wide range of repositories and offers a convenient one-stop-shop for discovery
of data on infectious and immune-mediated diseases (IIDs). The Discovery Portal
collects metadata from all included repositories on a regular basis and includes
it in the searchable catalogue for anybody to explore.

## Data access through repositories

No data is hosted by the Discovery Portal. The Discovery Portal does not provide direct
access to datasets but provides links to dataset landing pages with their
respective repositories. Users can use these links to explore datasets of
interest and obtain access as required by the repository that hosts the data.

The Discovery Portal can be used to:

- [Search across millions of datasets from numerous sources](/search/?q=&from=1&filters=%28%40type%3A%28%22Dataset%22%29%29),
  datasets that were previously unknown, to bring other dimensions into
  analyses.
- [Download metadata](/search/), access via
  [API](https://api.data.niaid.nih.gov/).
- Track research across funding programs or specific scientific areas.

## Interpret search results carefully

- The Discovery Portal does not aggregate every dataset from every source
  related to infectious and allergic disease. The Discovery Portal collects
  metadata from a defined list of
  [data repositories](/sources/) and
  standardizes them according to our <Link
  isExternal
  href='https://discovery.biothings.io/view/nde'>
  metadata schema</Link> . The list is continuously updated. Anybody is welcome to <Link
  isExternal
  href='https://github.com/NIAID-Data-Ecosystem/nde-crawlers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=suggest-a-new-resource.md&title=%5BSOURCE%5D'>
  suggest a data repository here</Link> .

- **Results may include irrelevant datasets.** The Discovery Portal also
  collects metadata from generalist repositories and search results may include
  datasets that are not related to infectious or immune-mediated diseases
  (IIDs).

- **Metadata fields may be incomplete.** The Discovery Portal attempts to
  standardize metadata that is made available by data repositories. If metadata
  from the repositories is missing or incomplete, it will also be missing or
  incomplete within the Discovery Portal. NIAID is working with the community to
  improve the completeness, quality, and consistency of metadata, in accordance
  with the <Link
  isExternal
  href='https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18'>
  FAIR Guiding Principles</Link> .

## Partnership

The NIAID Data Ecosystem is being developed by a large number of partners.
Foremost, the numerous data repositories who host the data and provide metadata.
Data repositories include domain specific repositories for infectious and
immune-mediated disease data, some of which are supported by NIAID, and also
general repositories. The Discovery Portal is being developed by <Link
isExternal href='https://www.scripps.edu/'>Scripps Research</Link> and built upon previous work in
collaboration with Seven Bridges. NIAID is also working with partners across
NIH, the US Government, and beyond to align the architecture and vision of the
NIAID Ecosystem with similar systems elsewhere. The NIAID Data Ecosystem is in
early stages of development and the partnerships will continue to expand as we
continue to improve the capabilities and value of the Ecosystem to the research
community.
