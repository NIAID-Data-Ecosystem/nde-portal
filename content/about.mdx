# Metadata-driven data discovery

The NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal enables users to find datasets from a 
wide range of repositories and offers a convenient one-stop-shop for discovery of 
data on infectious and immune-mediated diseases (IIDs). The Discovery Portal
regularly collects metadata from all included repositories and indexes
it in a searchable catalogue for anyone to explore.

# Data access through repositories

Datasets are not stored in the Discovery Portal. The Discovery Portal 
does not provide direct access to datasets but provides links to dataset landing 
pages within their respective repositories. Users can use these links to explore 
datasets of interest and obtain access as required by the repository.

The Discovery Portal can be used to:

- [Search across millions of datasets from numerous sources](/search/?q=&from=1&filters=%28%40type%3A%28%22Dataset%22%29%29),
  datasets that were previously unknown, to bring other dimensions into
  analyses.
- [Download metadata](/search/) or access via
  [API](https://api.data.niaid.nih.gov/).
- Track research across funding programs or specific scientific areas.

# Interpret search results carefully

- The Discovery Portal does not aggregate every dataset from every source
  related to IID. The Discovery Portal collects metadata from a defined list 
  of [data repositories](/sources/) and standardizes them according to our <Link
  isExternal href='https://discovery.biothings.io/view/nde'> metadata schema</Link>. 
  The list is continuously updated. Anyone is welcome to <Link isExternal
  href='https://github.com/NIAID-Data-Ecosystem/nde-crawlers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=suggest-a-new-resource.md&title=%5BSOURCE%5D'>
  suggest a data repository here</Link>.

- Results may include irrelevant datasets. The Discovery Portal also
  collects metadata from generalist repositories and search results may include
  datasets that are not related to IIDs.

- Metadata fields may be incomplete. The Discovery Portal attempts to
  standardize metadata that is made available by data repositories. If metadata
  from the repositories is missing or incomplete, it will also be missing or
  incomplete within the Discovery Portal. NIAID is working with the community to
  improve the completeness, quality, and consistency of metadata, in accordance
  with the <LinkisExternal href='https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18'>FAIR Guiding Principles</Link>.

# Partnership

The NIAID Data Ecosystem is being developed by a large number of partners - foremost, the numerous data repositories who host the data and provide metadata.
Data repositories include domain specific repositories for IID data, some of 
which are supported by NIAID, and general repositories. The Discovery Portal is 
being developed by Scripps Research and built upon previous work in collaboration 
with Seven Bridges. NIAID is also working with partners across NIH, the US Government, 
and beyond to align the architecture and vision of the NIAID Ecosystem with similar 
systems elsewhere. The NIAID Data Ecosystem is in early stages of development and the 
partnerships will continue to expand as we continue to improve the capabilities and 
value of the Ecosystem to the research community.
