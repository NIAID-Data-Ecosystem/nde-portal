# About the Discovery Portal

The NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal has been developed by the
[Office of Data Science and Emerging Technologies (ODSET)](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/office-data-science-and-emerging-technologies)
in partnership with [Scripps Research](https://www.scripps.edu/) to enhance the
findability of data. It allows users to search simultaneously across millions of
publicly available datasets to find immune-mediated and infectious disease data
for reanalysis.

The Discovery Portal aggregates data across numerous
sources, including NIAID-supported repositories, general biomedical
repositories, and other generalist sources. See the
[data sources](https://data-staging.niaid.nih.gov/portal/sources/).

The Discovery Portal can be used to:

- [Search across millions of datasets from numerous sources](https://data-staging.niaid.nih.gov/portal/search/?q=&from=1&filters=%28%40type%3A%28%22Dataset%22%29%29),
  datasets that were previously unknown, to bring other dimensions into
  analyses.
- [Download metadata](https://data-staging.niaid.nih.gov/portal/search/), access
  via [API](https://api.data.niaid.nih.gov/), or use the
  [metadata visualization tools](https://data-staging.niaid.nih.gov/portal/summary/?q=&from=1&filters=)
  to gather new insights about whatâ€™s available.
- Track research across funding programs or specific scientific areas.

Please note:

- **It includes a limited number of data sources.** The Discovery Portal does
  not aggregate every dataset from every source related to infectious and
  allergic disease. The Discovery Portal pulls from a
  [list of data sources](https://data-staging.niaid.nih.gov/portal/sources/).

- **Results may include irrelevant datasets.** As the Discovery Portal
  aggregates data from some generalist repositories, search results may include
  datasets that are not related to immune-mediated, allergic, or infectious
  disease.

- **Data cannot be directly downloaded or analyzed within the Discovery
  Portal.** The Discovery Portal is not a repository. The Discovery Portal can
  be used to search across repositories to find if/where data exists. It helps
  support the FAIRness of data. However, users cannot analyze data in the
  Discovery Portal, nor download data directly from the Discovery Portal.

- **Metadata fields may be incomplete.** The Discovery Portal attempts to
  standardize metadata that is available; however, it cannot create information
  that does not exist. If metadata is missing at the source, it will also be
  absent within the Discovery Portal.
