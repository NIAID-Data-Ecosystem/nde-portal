The Center is constructing a high-capacity scalable integrated knowledge environment enabling federated access, intuitive querying and integrative analysis and visualization across all LINCS resources and many additional external data types from other relevant resources. The Centerâ€™s data science research projects are aimed at addressing various data integration and intracellular molecular regulatory network challenges. The Center aims to develop: 1) methods to connect cellular and organismal phenotypes with molecular cellular signatures, and 2) novel data visualization methods for dynamically interacting with large-genomics and proteomics datasets.',

          'Vivli is an independent non-profit organization launched in 2016. Vivli evolved from a project of The Multi-Regional Clinical Trials Center of Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and Harvard(MRCT Center) to enhance access to clinical trials data by promoting data sharing and transparency. In 2013, the MRCT Center and a diverse group of global stakeholders embarked on a mission to define, design, and launch an innovative platform solution for global clinical trial data sharing. The Vivli platform provides access to anonymized individual participant-level data(IPD) or the raw data that is collected during a clinical trial. The clinical trials represented in Vivli are global and contributed by a diverse group of data contributors. By serving as a global trusted platform, Vivli increases the discoverability of available data in the wider research ecosystem, and increases the overall capacity worldwide for effective data sharing, aggregation, re-use, and novel analysis of valuable clinical research data to advance science and improve public health. The Vivli platform is a cloud-based platform that consists of a dynamic search engine, a data repository, and a secure research environment.',

HuBMAP has connected with these programs to ensure data interoperability, avoid duplication of work, and leverage and synergize gained knowledge. The consortium has organized a number of events to bring together these communities to discuss topics of shared interest and is committed to improving coordination and collaboration among different programs. In addition, many of the HuBMAP PIs had been or are still actively participating in these efforts, helping with cross-pollination and advancing our global understanding. HuBMAP, as its name implies, was specifically initiated to resolve the challenge of building integrated, comprehensive, high-resolution spatial maps of human tissues and organs, which has resulted in HuBMAP providing leadership in the ecosystem around techniques for integrating disparate, multi-dimensional and multi-scale datasets, the development of a Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) for integrating data across many individuals, and the development and validation of these assays. To further increase interoperability, HuBMAP has adopted a number of standards and processes developed by other domain expert consortia, working and is actively involved in the knowledge exchange. The consortium sees itself as an integral part of the ecosystem, sharing its strengths and actively contributing to the community.',
